==================

What if: little language for interactively specifying
collections of rectilinear shapes, not necessarily voxels.

state consists of
- maybe a value stack or something
- a mapping from strings to cubes

projection operations on cubes can lead to faces
clicking on a face selects face

faces have paths from the root to name them?

every cube has a name, nonce names are generated if they aren't
explicitly given them.

when we define functions to encapsulate larger operations, they can
give structured names to subcomponents
